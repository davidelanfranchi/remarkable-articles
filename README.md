### Design

* #### [26 Steps of Product & Dashboard Design](https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/26-steps-of-product-dashboard-design-c97af84c4146)<br>**Jan Losert, 2016**

  An in-depth article about the author's product design process. I like the careful division of his design steps and the all-embracing approach of the article. A find it a good reminder of how to work as a professional.

* #### [Space in Design Systems](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/space-in-design-systems-188bcbae0d62)<br>**Nathan Curtis, 2016**

  A development oriented design article. I like the methodical approach of the author and how he stress the connection between design and code, illustrating how to translate into SASS the approach described.

  Worth reading from the same author: [color](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/color-in-design-systems-a1c80f65fa3) and [buttons](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/buttons-in-design-systems-eac3acf7e23).

### Development

* #### [ABEM. A more useful adaptation of BEM.](https://css-tricks.com/abem-useful-adaptation-bem/)<br>**Daniel Tonon, 2017**

  The advantages of the approach suggested by the author seemed so obvious to me that I found the article inspiring. It suggests a very useful adaptation of BEM naming convention showing that instead of blindly following the rules, we could, and we should, break/adjust them.

  It made me think about another not so standardized convention that I found clever: [rscss](http://rscss.io/).

* #### [Everything Easy is Hard Again](https://frankchimero.com/writing/everything-easy-is-hard-again/)<br>**Frank Chimero, 2017**

  Brilliant and frank essay about the **increasing complexity of the web industry**. I loved the ability of the author to simplify, to narrow down his considerations to what makes a great design and to be so generous, writing about his personal experience. Being myself worried about the implications of the _“Move fast and break things”_ mantra and the increasingly opacity of the open web, I took comfort in the knowledge that I'm in (very) good company. Moreover, too many times I find myself adding complexity for the sake of complexity, or because is the way to do things... this month.\
  Finally, I found illuminating the provocative connection between HTML tables and CSS Grid to describe the circular nature of making websites:

  > you’ll eventually end up in the same spot: your first year of making websites.

* #### [I totally forgot about print style sheets](https://uxdesign.cc/i-totally-forgot-about-print-style-sheets-f1e6604cfd6)<br>**Manuel Matuzovic, 2016**

  I feel ashamed, but the title speaks also for me. Too many times I barely think about print styles. The article is a good collection of basic best practices ensuring that a printed page won't be totally broken.

## Motivation

I never found a way to deal with the overwhelming amount of information that is published every day in the world wide web. For this reason I decided to maintain and share a list of links that I consider significant: articles that offer a particular perspective on a topic, a provocative opinion or that are particularly thorough about a subject.

I thought that the friction due to write bookmarks by hand and the public dimension of a repository could make a difference in the way I store links that I find remarkable. Moreover, in perspective, I like the idea of version control what I found important during time.

I'll try to:

* stick to a few categories and links;
* write a short comment about the linked article;
* keep the list updated;

I would like to avoid the excessive growth of the list that would make it useless, remember why I found an article interesting and keep only the articles that continues to ring a bell to me, also after some time.

The repository is intended to be a personal way to stop losing inputs and ideas found online. However, I'll be very happy and grateful if you follow an impulse to open an issue or make a pull request to discuss an article, suggest a related link, recommend a reading that you found meaningful or whatever.
