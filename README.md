### Development

* #### [Everything Easy is Hard Again](https://frankchimero.com/writing/everything-easy-is-hard-again/)<br>**Frank Chimero, 2017**

  Brilliant and frank essay about the **increasing complexity of the web industry**. I loved the ability of the author to simplify, to narrow down his considerations to what makes a great design and to be so generous, writing about his personal experience. Being myself worried about the implications of the _“Move fast and break things”_ mantra and the increasingly opacity of the open web, I took comfort in the knowledge that I'm in (very) good company. Moreover, too many times I find myself adding complexity for the sake of complexity, or because is the way to do things... this month.\
  Finally, I found illuminating the provocative connection between HTML tables and CSS Grid to describe the circular nature of making websites:

  > you’ll eventually end up in the same spot: your first year of making websites.

## Motivation

I never found a way to deal with the overwhelming amount of information that is published every day in the world wide web. For this reason I decided to maintain and share a list of links that I consider significant: articles that offer a particular perspective on a topic, a provocative opinion or that are particularly thorough about a subject.

I thought that the friction due to write bookmarks by hand and the public dimension of a repository could make a difference in the way I store links that I find remarkable. Moreover, in perspective, I like the idea of version control what I found important during time.

I'll try to:

* stick to a few categories and links;
* write a short comment about the linked article;
* keep the list updated;

I would like to avoid the excessive growth of the list that would make it useless, remember why I found an article interesting and keep only the articles that continues to ring a bell to me, also after some time.

The repository is intended to be a personal way to stop losing inputs and ideas found online. However, I'll be very happy and grateful if you follow an impulse to open an issue or make a pull request to discuss an article, suggest a related link, recommend a reading that you found meaningful or whatever.
